<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
# About The Project
This is a practice project for Javascript where we will be building a Library with Book objects.

You can Create a New Book Object by using the New Book Button, which will display a form to insert the book Title, Author and Pages and then clicking submit, which will pass the inputs of the form and save them into a new Book Object.

You can Update the Book's status from Read to Unread and visceversa by just pressing the status button that corresponds to each book.

Lastly, you can remove a book from the Library. This will also remove the book from local storage.
